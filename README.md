**Hey there :wave:**


# The challenge
### Users should be able to:

  - View the optimal layout for the app on only desktop layout
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
  - Upvote and downvote comments
  - **Bonus: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.**
  - **Bonus: Instead of using the **createdAt** strings from the **data.json** file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.**
